	abstract = {We present approximation algorithms for median problems in metric spaces and fixed-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Our algorithms use a new method for transforming an optimal solution of the linear program relaxation of the s-median problem into a provably good integral solution. This transformation technique is fundamentally different from the methods of randomized and deterministic rounding [7,8] and the methods proposed in [6] in the following way: Previous techniques never set variables with zero values in the fractional solution to 1. This departure from previous methods is crucial for the success of our algorithms.},

The problem involve the location of K noxious facilities that are to be placed as far as possilbe from the other facilities, and the objective is to maximize the minimum distance from the noxious facilities to the others. We then show that two other bottleneck (min-max) location problems, finding K-centers and absolute K-centers of a graph appear to be very difficult to solve even for reasonably good approximate solutions.},

	doi = {10.1145/2701615},
	abstract = {We consider a network creation game in which each player (vertex) has a fixed budget to establish links to other players. In our model, each link has unit price and each agent tries to minimize its cost, which is either its local diameter or its total distance to other players in the (undirected) underlying graph of the created network. Two versions of the game are studied: in the {MAX} version, the cost incurred to a vertex is the maximum distance between the vertex and other vertices, and in the {SUM} version, the cost incurred to a vertex is the sum of distances between the vertex and other vertices. We prove that in both versions pure Nash equilibria exist, but the problem of finding the best response of a vertex is {NP}-hard. We take the social cost of the created network to be its diameter, and next we study the maximum possible diameter of an equilibrium graph with n vertices in various cases. When the sum of players' budgets is n-1, the equilibrium graphs are always trees, and we prove that their maximum diameter is Theta(n) and Theta(log n) in {MAX} and {SUM} versions, respectively. When each vertex has unit budget (i.e. can establish link to just one vertex), the diameter of any equilibrium graph in either version is Theta(1). We give examples of equilibrium graphs in the {MAX} version, such that all vertices have positive budgets and yet the diameter is Omega(sqrt(log n)). This interesting (and perhaps counter-intuitive) result shows that increasing the budgets may increase the diameter of equilibrium graphs and hence deteriorate the network structure. Then we prove that every equilibrium graph in the {SUM} version has diameter 2{\textasciicircum}O(sqrt(log n)). Finally, we show that if the budget of each player is at least k, then every equilibrium graph in the {SUM} version is k-connected or has diameter smaller than 4.},

	abstract = {We present efficient new randomized and deterministic methods for transforming optimal solutions for a type of relaxed integer linear program into provably good solutions for the corresponding {NP}-hard discrete optimization problem. Without any constraint violation, the ε-approximation problem for many problems of this type is itself {NP}-hard. Our methods provide polynomial-time ε-approximations while attempting to minimize the packing constraint violation. Our methods lead to the first known approximation algorithms with provable performance guarantees for the s-median problem, the tree prunning problem, and the generalized assignment problem. These important problems have numerous applications to data compression, vector quantization, memory-based learning, computer graphics, image processing, clustering, regression, network location, scheduling, and communication. We provide evidence via reductions that our approximation algorithms are nearly optimal in terms of the packing constraint violation. We also discuss some recent applications of our techniques to scheduling problems.},

The for each problem is to cost the sum of distances from demand points to their respective nearest supply points. It is proved that the p-center and the p-median problems relative to both the Euclidean and the rectilinear metrics are {NP}-hard. In fact, it is proved that it is {NP}-hard even to approximate the p-center problems sufficiently closely. The reductions are from 3-satisfiability.},
